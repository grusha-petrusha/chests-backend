# Description

Chests is a logic card game. The essence of the game is to collect cards for yourself by guessing them from opponents, using leading questions. For this game, a playing deck of 36 or 52 cards is used. The number of participating people ranges from 2 to 6. So, one or more players can be the winners.

# Goal

The goal of the game is to accumulate as much as possible, than other players, the number of "chests" - full fours of cards of the same rank. The losers are those who have collected a smaller number of "chests".

# Rules

1. First, all players receive 4 cards by dealing one card in a circle. Now, each player begins to take turns asking the opponents special questions.
2. If the answer to the question is positive (the player guessed the opponent's cards), he takes the guessed cards for himself. In the basic rules, the question is asked to the player on the left (clockwise), but there are options when the question can be asked to any opponent.
3. Guessing cards is made according to certain properties, therefore, the following types of questions are distinguished:
   - the opponent has cards of a certain value (for example, eight, kings, queens, etc.);
   - how many cards of the guessed value the player has (the answer can be a number from 1 to 3);
   - what suits of the guessed number of cards in the opponent's hands (they must be listed all by the number of guessed cards). A number of rule variations allow you to ask the colors of the cards before guessing the suit.
4. Questions are asked one by one in the sequence as indicated in the rules. For each positive answer, the player asks the next question. If the answer to the last question is yes, then the player who asked him takes the guessed cards from his opponent and starts asking questions from the beginning again.
5. In case of a negative answer to any of the questions asked, the player who asked the question must take one card from the deck. In this case, the move goes to the other player clockwise.
6. A player may run out of cards in his hand. Then he takes a card from the deck. After collecting the "chest" in his hands, the player needs to lay them out (remove from his hand). The collected "chest" is shown only by agreement of the players.
